# Search_Cluster_Vectors_CPP
University Assignment: Implement LSH algorithm for d-dimensional vectors in C++

We can run it like this, from outside of the `src/` folder

`make && ./lsh -d Datasets/dataset -q Datasets/queryset -k 4 -L 1 -o file -N 2 -R 10000`

**File paths have to be without ""**
_Provided that we have the dataset in the folder ./Datasets/dataset_
